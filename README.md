# Transformer-based Fallacious Argument Classification in Political Debates

In this repository you find the code which was used for the experiments in our paper [Fallacious Argument Classification in Political Debates]() (IJCAI-ECAI 2022).

In our work, we evaluate Longformer transformer models for 
1) Argument Classification (Sequence Classification Task)

on political debates.

# Requirements/Setup
The code runs under Python 3.6 or higher. The required packages are listed in the requirements.txt, which can be directly installed from the file:

```
pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
```

Our code is based on the transformer library version 4.18.0. See https://github.com/huggingface/transformers for more details.
